This Dice_Simulator Java program is a simple simulation of rolling multiple dice. It's useful for learning Java programming fundamentals like:

Loops (for)

User input (Scanner)

Random number generation (Random)

Variables and arithmetic

Console output (System.out.print/println)

# The purpose of this program is to:

Let the user enter the number of dice they want to roll.

Simulate rolling each die using random numbers from 1 to 6.

Print the outcome of each die roll.

Calculate and display the total of all dice rolled.

It mimics the behavior of rolling real dice, which is useful in games, simulations, or as a beginner programming project.

# Example Output:

Enter the no of dice: 4
Hey User! You rolled:
3 6 2 5 
Total: 16
